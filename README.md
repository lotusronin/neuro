# Neuro

The Neuro Language is a mixed paradigm programming language I am developing trying to integrate features from
various modern languages while still remaining performant.

## Inspirations
The following are languages I have been inspired by in the design of my own language:
- Rust
- C
- D
- Scala
- Haskell

## Planned and Potential Features
The following are ideas that are planned or I am considering for the language:
* Planned
  - Templates
  - Lambdas
  - For-each Loops
  - UFCS
  - Type Introspection
* Potential
  - Until loops
  - Owned memory
  - ADTs
